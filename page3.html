                <h2>Preliminary Risk and Additional Concerns</h2>
                <div>
                    <ol>
                        <li>
                            Resource Scarcity: The development of a top-down real-time strategy game like the one described will require a substantial amount of art assets, including game sprites, animations, and other visual effects. Securing free assets that are suitable for the game may be a challenge and creating our own assets will be time consuming, and outsourcing assets can be costly.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            AI Complexity: The AI-controlled units and their ability to automatically fire projectiles add a layer of complexity to the game. Developing advanced AI algorithms that create challenging, yet fair gameplay experiences can be a significant technical challenge.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Balancing Gameplay: Achieving a balanced and enjoyable gameplay experience is crucial. Balancing both factions and the interaction between player actions, mob and asset behaviors, and environmental elements may require extensive playtesting and iteration.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Story and Lore Integration: The game's lore and story should seamlessly integrate with gameplay. Developing a compelling narrative that enhances the player's experience while avoiding plot holes or inconsistencies is a potential risk.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Project Scope Creep: Managing the project's scope is crucial to meet deadlines and budget constraints. Scope creep, where the project continuously expands beyond the original plan, can jeopardize the project's success.
                        </li>
                    </ol>
                    <p>
                        It's essential to have a comprehensive risk management plan in place to address these concerns, continually assess potential challenges, and adapt to unforeseen issues throughout the development process. Project sponsors and stakeholders should provide input and support to mitigate these risks and ensure the project's feasibility.
